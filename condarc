# channels - Channels are URL's which conda will use in the specified order to look
# for packages. Non-URL channels will be assumed to be Anaconda.org usernames.
# If no channels is specified, conda uses some internal defaults.
channels:
   - file:///home/vagrant/conda_builds
   - defaults

# Setting this to true means that conda will assume Yes as an answer before installing a package.
# it will not keep asking you. Lets set to False, so you can check what you are doing.
always_yes: False


# Show channel URLs when displaying what is going to be downloaded and
# when you run 'conda list'. The default is False.
# look at the last column in "conda list" which displays the channel information.
show_channel_urls: True

# When you run the activate command to switch to a conda environment. change the
# command prompt to display the environment path
changeps1: True

# When listing python packages that are installed, use output of pip
# command also. Does not effect conda functionality in anyway.
use_pip: True

# If you are behind a firewall, you can set proxy servers here
#proxy_servers:

# Offline mode means that filter out all channel URLs which do not use the file:// protocol.
# The default is False.
offline: False

# When a channel specified is not a URL, conda uses the channel_alias setting and appends the
# given channel name to the channel_alias to arrive at a URL. Default channel_alias is
# https://conda.anaconda.org
# So channel abcd means https://conda.anaconda.org/abcd
# conda install --channel asmeurer <package> also means
# conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/asmeurer <package> 
channel_alias: http://conda.anaconda.org

# When creating a new conda environment add these packages by default:
# create_default_packages:
#  - ipython

# You can also build packages using "conda build" command. There are options to control this.
# conda can automatically upload packages built with "conda_build" to anaconda.
# anaconda_upload will prevent this
anaconda_upload: False

# conda packages will by default be installed to this folder:
# by default it is conda_install_dir/conda-builds
conda-build:
  root-dir: '/home/vagrant/conda_builds'
